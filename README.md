App Brainstorming

Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app. Its okay if features repeat on different apps

  Instagram, the first feature I want to list is being able to watch videos and share them with others, I like the feature to watch  your friend's stories, through short videos and pictures.
YouTube, The first feature I want to list is being able to listen to music and play music videos, the second feature I like is that we can leave comments and likes if we enjoy watching something.
Facebook, The first feature I want to list is being able to communicate with people all over the world, Secondly, I like being able to leave a post on our profile page.

Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. You are not committing to this idea, but it helps to start brain storming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors

The app Scorpion is a social media app that will connect users across the world and allow them to share messages, videos, and posts with other users. I want to make this a safe space for users to explore and discover new cultures and experiences. I want users to be able to connect with their family and friends across the world. I want to allow people to express themselves freely and openly.
